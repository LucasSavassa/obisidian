# asp.net core identity vs oidc
## asp.net core identity
asp.net core identity uses databases
asp.net core identity serves only the asp.net core app that declared it
## oidc
[oidc](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-openid-connect-oidc) provides **single sign-on**
![[Pasted image 20250919091501.png]]
oidc is a protocol that extends oauth2
oidc can provide authentication services to multiple apps (multi-tenant)
oidc authenticates the user, then builds a claim, then turn it into a token
