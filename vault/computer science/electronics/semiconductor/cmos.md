### CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)

**How it works:**  
Uses complementary pairs of **p-type and n-type MOSFETs** (transistors) to implement logic gates.

**Key Characteristics:**

|Feature|CMOS|
|---|---|
|Power consumption|Very low when idle|
|Speed|High (especially in modern chips)|
|Noise immunity|High|
|Fan-out|High|
|Static current draw|Almost zero (only uses power when switching)|
|Integration density|Very high (used in modern ICs and CPUs)|
|Voltage levels|Often 3.3V or 5V (modern ones may use 1.8V or lower)|

**Used in:**  
Modern processors, microcontrollers, memory chips, and most integrated circuits today.
