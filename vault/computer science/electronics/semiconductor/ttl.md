### TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic)

**How it works:**  
Built using **bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)** instead of MOSFETs.

**Key Characteristics:**

|Feature|TTL|
|---|---|
|Power consumption|Higher than CMOS|
|Speed|Moderate (older technology)|
|Noise immunity|Lower than CMOS|
|Fan-out|Limited|
|Static current draw|Continuous (even when idle)|
|Integration density|Lower (compared to CMOS)|
|Voltage levels|Typically 5V logic|

**Used in:**  
Older digital circuits, legacy systems, some simple logic chips (like 7400 series ICs).
