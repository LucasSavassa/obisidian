# crystal oscillator (quartz crystal)
Most common in computers and microcontrollers        
Uses mechanical vibrations of a quartz crystal to maintain a very stable frequency (like 16 MHz, 100 MHz, etc.)
# rc oscillator (resistor-capacitor)
Cheaper but less accurate        
Used in low-precision or low-power systems        
# mems oscillator
Uses microelectromechanical systems; compact and rugged        
# pll (phase-locked loop) based oscillator
Generates high-frequency clocks from lower-frequency references        
Used in CPUs and FPGAs for internal clock generation
