- computers have components that help perform computation (like alu, [[ram]], rom)
- but they also have components to enable [[user interaction]], like:
	- [[display monitor]]
	- mouse
	- [[keyboard]]
	- speakers
	- microphone
	- printer
	- network interface
	- others
- the computer doesn't need to know how to translate digital data into physical output (sound and image) or vice-versa
- usually io devices come equipped with a dedicated controller so this responsibility can be offloaded from cpu to these controllers
