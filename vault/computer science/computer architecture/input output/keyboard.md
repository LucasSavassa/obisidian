- computers reserve a region in ram to interact with a display monitor
- this region is called **keyboard memory map**
- this region doesn't need so many registers, since one 16 bit register can represent 65,536 different keys
- in fact, only one register is needed
- instead of calling it **keyboard memory map**, you could call it **keyboard register**
- not true
- because the user can press two keys at the same time
- if the operating system is designed to allow two keys pressed at the same time, the amount of bits needed is:
	- k - number of keys in the keyboard
	- n - number of simultaneous keys supported by operating system
	- k^n - bits
	- if k = 255, n = 2, then at least 16 bits
