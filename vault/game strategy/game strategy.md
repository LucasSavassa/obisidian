What if I spending my years working hard and still fail?
I arrive 08h at office, and leave at 20h
I spend my time building a web site and learning chinese
Today I tried to read an article about authentication and felt overwhelmed
I'm enduring this because I believe it will lead to money
What if it doesn't?

if you keep nurturing unrealistic expection, you will be forever frustrated

put your life away from your hands, let go of your sense of control
do your best and just accept whatever happens to you
