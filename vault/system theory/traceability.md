properties needed:
- uniqueness
- reversibility
- compression

the output of a system should receive a unique identifier

maybe two

hid - hash - uniqueness
cid - crypto - compress and revert back

when this output is used as input by another system, the crypto id must be used to generate the next unique identifier

this way, you can trace all production details from one string
