1. **steeping**: the grain (barley or wheat) is steeped in water to initiate germination
2. **germination**: steeped grains are germinated in controlled conditions to produce enzymes and break grain's starches (amido) into simpler sugars
3. **kilning**: the germinated grain is dried and possibly toasted to develop flavor and color
4. **storing**: the produced malt is stored in silos

# step 2: mashing
| step   | material    |
| ------ | ----------- |
| input  | malt        |
| input  | hot water   |
| output | wort        |
| output | spent grain |

1. **grinding (milling)**: grind malt into grist to change the shape of the grain, exposing its interior and facilitating the next step
2. **mash tun**: mix hot water and grist to catalyze the enzymatic process of turning starch into sugar (saccharification)
3. **lauter tun:** the lauter tun purifies the mash by separating the liquid wort (mosto) from the grain
> spent grain (grain sprout shells and insoluble proteins) is another output of the mashing process, which is valuable high-quality feed in cattle farming
